# YOLO Object Detection

## Datasets
1. [**SkyFusion: Aerial Object Detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kailaspsudheer/tiny-object-detection): Dataset for detecting tiny objects in satellite images, addressing the gap in datasets focused on small objects like vehicles, ships, and aircraft. It is a curated subset of the AiTOD v2 and Airbus Aircraft Detection datasets, optimized for accessibility and research in tiny object detection.
2. [**Traffic Sign Detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/cardetection): Dataset focusing on identifying and classifying common traffic signs to support computer vision applications. It includes images of various traffic signs, such as traffic lights (Green, Red), speed limit signs (ranging from 10 to 120 km/h), and Stop signs, representing a diverse range of real-world road scenarios.
3. [**Fruits Detection**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshaytyagi01/fruit-detection): Dataset containing images of six fruit types: Apple, Grapes, Pineapple, Orange, Banana, and Watermelon, annotated for object detection tasks. Each image has undergone preprocessing, including auto-orientation with EXIF data stripping.
